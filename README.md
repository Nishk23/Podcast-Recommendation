# Context
Podcast exists for near two decades. But it really takes over in recent two years. The podcast meta data may be useful for research in fields like machine learning, social science, or media in general.

# Content
Listen Notes is the podcast search engine that actually works. It has the most comprehensive podcast database that you can find on the Internet.

This dataset includes the meta data of (almost) all podcast episodes that were published in December 2017.

If you are building apps / online services that need to access THE podcast database (i.e., all podcasts and all episodes o the Internet), then you can try our Listen API: Podcast Search & Directory API. It's freemium model and pay as you go.
